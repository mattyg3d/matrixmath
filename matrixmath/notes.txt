//The determinant of a matrix

To determine the invertibility of a matrix, a row of zeros means a matrix is not invertible.

Defn;: Given a square matrix, A, The determinant of a matrix is a number that determines the invertibility of A.

Notation
det(A) = |A|

If det(A) = 0, A is not invertible, and vise versa.

Case I:
A is 1x1

A=|a|

| A ; I_1 | -> | a ; 1|

1/a Row_1 -> Row_1

|1 ; 1/a|


Case 2:

A is 2x2

|A ; I_2| -> |a b ; 1 0|
             |c d ; 0 1|

aRow_2 -> Row_2

|a  b  ; 1  0|
|ac ad ; 0  a|

Row_2 - cRow_1 = Row_2

|a   b   ; 1  0|
|0 ad-bc ; -c a|

ad - bc = det(A)

Case 3:
go to one drive im not writing this out lol



defn:
Given an nxn matrix, A, the ij-minor of A is the determinant of the (n-1)x(n-1)
matrix created by eliminating the ith row and jth column of A.


Cofactor Matrix
Given a nxn matrix, A, its matrix of cofactors is the matrix whose entries are the cofactors of A.
Notation

M_c
[M_c_ij] = [C_ij]

A = |1 2|
    |3 4|
M_c = [+4 -3]
      [-2 +1]

Defn: The adjoint of A is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of A.
Notation adj(a) = M_c^T

A = |1 2|
    |3 4|
M_c = [4 -3]
      [-2 1]

M_c^T = [4 -2]
        [-3 1]

The inverse of A^-1

A^-1 = 1/det(A) * adf(A)
